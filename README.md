JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. It's essentially a translator that lets Java applications talk to databases.

Here's a breakdown of JDBC:

What it does:
Connects Java programs to various databases, allowing data retrieval, manipulation, and storage.
Provides a standard interface for database access regardless of the specific database system being used (like MySQL, Oracle, etc.)
How it works:

JDBC relies on a set of classes and interfaces (JDBC API) included in the Java SE platform.
To connect to a particular database, a separate JDBC driver is needed. This driver translates JDBC calls into commands specific to that database.

Here's a simplified process:
The Java program imports the JDBC API classes.
It loads the specific JDBC driver for the target database.
The program uses JDBC API methods to connect, execute SQL statements, and process results.

Benefits of using JDBC:
Database independence: JDBC applications can work with different databases without code modifications.
Platform independence: Java applications using JDBC can run on various operating systems.
Security: JDBC provides mechanisms for secure database access control.


Project Structure:-
 There are 3 classes-
 1. Patient: In patient Class there are 3 methods - addPatient() , viewPatient(), checkPatient().
 2. Doctors: In doctors Class there are 2 methods - viewDoctor(), checkDoctor().
 3. Hospital Management System : In Hospital Management System, There is Driver class and use both classes(Patient, Doctors) , there is main menu also and exit..
